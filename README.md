I created this application to make it easier to search for users and their repositories. The framework used is React, and the purpose of this project was to develop my knowledge, which is in the process of improvement.

	This is the homepage.

	To search for a user or several users whose username begins with the searched sequence, we must write the sequence in the input component and press search.
